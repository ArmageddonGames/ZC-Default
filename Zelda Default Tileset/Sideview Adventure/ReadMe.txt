Thank you for purchasing #NotZelda2 Sideview Adventure Tiles. Inside there should be environment tiles, dungeon tiles, characters, enemies, items, visual FX, and fonts.

The goal for #NotZelda2 is to help game makers make sideview adventure games. I regularly add to this tileset, and eventually I hope it's filled with anything anyone needs to make their adventure games.

Suggested Tools:
Paint.net
Tiled Map Editor
Aseprite
Pyxel Editor
Unity
Multimedia Fusion
